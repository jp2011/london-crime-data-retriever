# About
This repository is a little manual on how to access London [Police Data](https://data.police.uk/) in a more user-friendly way than downloading separate CSV files. Note that this offers data only for London even though the portal offers data for the whole country.

# Steps to retrieve the data

1. Download the dataset from [Kaggle](kaggle.com/jp2011/london-crime) as `crime.db` file. The file can be used as a SQLite database.


# Examples of usage


# Warnings
Please, regularly check [the Changelog](https://data.police.uk/changelog/) for any issues with the data.

Currently, for London data, the following issues are not yet resolved:
1. City of London data for the period starting on Sep 2017 until present are not yet available due to change of IT infrastructure at the CoL police.
